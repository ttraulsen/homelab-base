# Homelab Base

This repository contains the foundational setup for my personal homelab.

It includes:

- Host-level configuration and bootstrap scripts
- Architectural and operational documentation
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Recovery and reinstallation procedures

The goal of this homelab is:

- Self-hosted, privacy-friendly services for a family environment
- Low operational overhead
- High reproducibility
- A documented and explainable setup
