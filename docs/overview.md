# Homelab Overview

This homelab is a self-hosted environment running at home, primarily intended for:

- Family services (photos, password management, dashboards)
- Home automation and observability
- Learning and experimentation
- A documented reference architecture

Key principles:

- Prefer boring, well-known technology
- Automate where it makes sense, not everywhere
- Keep the system understandable months later
- Separate base infrastructure from applications

## Background

The original setup I use so far relies heavily on my Synology NAS.
Several services run directly on the NAS.
I use either official or community packages.

I also use one Raspberry Pi which runs HomeAssistant.

## General goal

I want a setup which is future proof but also powerful enough to run more services for myself.
Although the NAS is from 2014 it still can provide the storage needs I have.
For computational needs I need a more powerful solution which is also energy efficient.
