# Architectural Decisions

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

The goal is not to be exhaustive, but to document:

- Why a decision was made
- Which alternatives were considered
- What trade-offs were accepted

This documentation is intended for:

- Future me
- Curious readers
- Recovery and redesign scenarios
